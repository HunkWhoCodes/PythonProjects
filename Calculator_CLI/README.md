    # Calculator CLI

    ### Introduction
    A basic calculator CLI application in python. This currently allows 6 operations.

    ### Requirements
    Python 3.x

    ### Installation and Usage:
    - Nothing just execute the main file: `python main.py`
    - Then follow the prompts


    ### Concepts Learned / Revised:

    1. Using functions as objects, then calling these functions by reference and passing params to them.
    2. Using tuple as a value of a dictionary to condense menu and have consistency between menu and operations.
    3. Error handling in python with try - except
    4. Also, using loops and breaks to continue to take the input. e.g. in case of incorrect input or continuing calculations.
    5. Raising appropriate errors in case of invalid input
    6. Added a basic unittest file to check the calculations are correect or not and also how assertRaises is used
    7. Some ideas around __main__ as the entry point in main file, in imported file and where main is not explixtly defined (e.g. unittest file)
